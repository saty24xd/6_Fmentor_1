## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of semantic HTML and CSS custom properties. Here are some code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
```
```css
body {
  background-color: var(--color-stone-100);
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on responsive design and improving my CSS skills, particularly with Flexbox and Grid.

### Useful resources
